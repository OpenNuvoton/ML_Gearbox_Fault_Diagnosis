# ML_Gearbox_Fault_Diagnosis
- A "Hello world" example of tiny ml.
- This dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brjapon/gearbox-fault-diagnosis.
- We provide an example training script for this dataset, as well as code for converting it to TFLite and C source code.

## 1. First step
### 1. Install virtual env
- If you haven't installed [NuEdgeWise](https://github.com/OpenNuvoton/NuEdgeWise), please follow these steps to install Python virtual environment and ***choose `NuEdgeWise_env`***.
- Skip if you have done.
### 2. Running
- The `dnn.ipynb` or `autoencoder.ipynb` notebooks will assist you in preparing the data, training the model, and finally converting it to TFLite and C++ files.

## 2. Inference code
- The M460 inference code is also included in [ML_M460_Gearbox_SampleCode](https://github.com/OpenNuvoton/ML_M460_Gearbox_SampleCode).
