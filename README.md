- A "Hello world" example of tiny ml.
- This dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brjapon/gearbox-fault-diagnosis.
- We provide an example train script for this dataset and the tflite c scorce code converting.

## 1. First step

### 2. Running
- The `dnn.ipynb` or `autoencoder.ipynb` will help you prepare data, train the model, and finally convert to tflite & c++ file.

## 2. Inference code
- M460 inference code is also included in [ML_M460_Gearbox_SampleCode](https://github.com/OpenNuvoton/ML_M460_Gearbox_SampleCode).
